===== DAYTIME =====


1. 
1	192.168.126.128		129.6.15.28		TCP	[SYN] Seq=0 Win=32120 MSS=1460 Len=0 ...
2	129.6.15.28		192.168.126.128		TCP	[SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=64240 Len=0
3	192.168.126.128		129.6.15.28		TCP	[ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=32120 Len=0

2. Port number on client: 47092

3. The client needs a port to establish a connection with the port of the host server, in order to retrieve data. 

4. 
4	129.6.15.28		192.168.126.128		DAYTIME DAYTIME Response

5. [SYN] stands for synchronize and [ACK] stands for acknowledge.

6. The client established the closing of the connection. The client sends a FIN packet to the server to indicate that it has finished requesting data and would like the connection to be terminated. 
5 	192.168.126.128		129.6.15.28		TCP 	[SYN, ACK] Seq=1 Ack=53 Win=32068 Len=0

===== HTTP =====

1. 2 TCP connections were opened. The first one was opened and then eventually closed with a combindation of FIN, PSH, ACK packets. The second was opened, but then left with a TCP Keep-Alive.

2. The first HTTP packet sent to the server includes the following information: GET /index.html HTTP/1.1. Therefore, the homepage was requested. 
11	192.168.126.128		172.233.221.124		HTTP	GET /index.html HTTP/1.1

3.  jeff-square-Colorado.jpg was not requested because the image exists inside the index.html file whereas maisie-jeff.jpg exists under a different directory misc/ which requires another HTTP request.



===== QUESTIONS =====

Why does a FIN, PSH, ACK sequence of packets need to be sent after a FIN, ACK sequence?
